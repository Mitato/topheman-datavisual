##Requirements

* node
* grunt, bower
* sass
* yeoman (optional) generator-angular-fullstack (todo : specify version)

##Install

* grunt init to create the server/config/local.env.js - set your twitter credentials there
* grunt serve - you're good to go

For the moment the module `twitter-stream-channels` is still in dev and not yet published on npm. Some problems with npm link on windows, so I call the module with a relative path temporarily.
